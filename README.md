# Cody's coding vacations 🐊
## _A react development_

¡Hola mundo!

I have been looking for projects because practice makes the master and [Código Facilito](https://codigofacilito.com/usuarios/mis_cursos) just made a Challenge called  #VeranoFrontEnd or Summer Front End where we were suposed to help Cody to code his website.

For the Challenge I had to fork Cody's website and make changes to it 🐊.

## Initial Requirements 📋

- Original code must be forked
- All changes and ideas are welcomed
- Javascript and CSS frameworks are welcome
- Creativity is  up to the developer
- Semantic use of HTML tags

## My own requirements 🌟

- Not to repeat unnecesary code
- Use a package I never  used before
- Use React as JS Framework
- Use SASS as CSS Framework
- Try a modern and minimalistic style that fits Cody
- Clean console

## Built with 🔨
- Visual Code Studio: as code editor
- SASS
- React
- Node

## Development ⌨️

I started with a little hand drawing ✍️ of what  I thought could be a good layout this allowed me to be faster  as I already had an idea of what I wanted to do and also made it easier for me to prioritize the information.

Then I went  in for all. As I worked with React I split the code in Components and ended up with 8 of them plus my App.js. I also added a data folder to save all my JSON files 📂. JSON files are one of my favorite things in this project as they allowed me to write less code as I can map them and render them easily but they also guarantee a 🚧 low maintenance code. 🚧

In my own requirements I decided I wanted  to used  a NPM package that  I  never used before- As the original website has some images of Cody's vacations I went on the search of an Image Gallery🖼️ and used this [React Image Gallery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-gallery) It was pretty simple  to use, it is responsive and I think the final result was great.

I also used this 🍔[Burger Menu](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-burger-menu) that I found when I was doing my portfolio and I love it because is pretty easy to customize and looks really cute. However this Menu doesn't have a funcionality that I think is really important and that is that, when the user choose a nav item it doesn't close, so I added a  little function to do that.

There's a component that I personally love 💘 and that is the "Top.js". This component -that I think I'm gonna upload to NPM - is a "Scroll top" button that allows the user to...scroll up 🔝. It works really well, is visible only when the user start scrolling an disappears on top.

For my styles I installed SASS and using BEM tried to make it look cute, fresh and Cody like.

## Want to clone my repository? 🐑🐑
